		  					<p>As a freelancer, I liked the opportunities I had to work on various projects with different styles, problems and platforms. Now I’m focusing exclusively on Stripe, I realize how incomplete my work previously was. There’s a big difference between quickly designing someone else’s thing and building your own product—seeing it evolve, grow, and gain traction. I care much more now.</p>
		  					<p>The freedom and responsibility Stripe gives its employees contributes greatly to creating this design-friendly environment. When nobody above you comes with requirements full of user experience disasters, it’s easier to build something great. And when there’s basically nobody above you at all, you can decide what to build, design with the user in mind, and take the time to do it properly. As a result, Stripe feels like a side-project, something you do for fun where there’s no boring rules or constraining deadlines. For me, this is how good design can happen.</p>
